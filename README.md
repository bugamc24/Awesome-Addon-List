[I highly recommend disabling Recipe Radar Classic when it's not needed! I had issues with it bugging some other addons out!]



Install Clean Minimap first. I'm sure you understand why :) 

Once you log in, there might be quite a few things on your screen: 

Details!    Click on the addon's cogwheel to setup anytime. Tip: Make a profile that works for all your chars 

CombatTime Tracker  /ctt   Tip: I recommend choosing your preffered color and making the backdrop transparent

Death Counter     Jam it somewhere

TItan Panel Classic   Tip: Use top panel(or preffered) with Auto-Hide feature, check Addon settings in Interface Options

Questie   Tip: Remember that you can Hide/Show on World Map with just a button click shown on top of the World Map 

Clique You'll find it as a new button on the Spellbook 

Tale For this one you should check creators site where he gives all the information needed to understand it

TSM4(Trade Skill Master) might scare a noobie! It's quite an extensive proffesional addon, but nowadays it comes pretty well made withing the box with decent posting formulas(highly depends on your realm though). Learn to make a few groups of items and a posting/canceling up&down mousewheel macro and posting can't get easier and faster. Tip: When using the mousewheel macro in TSM, put the mouse cursor on different parts of the AH Interface to see where the macro works(I was spamming it outside of the UI and lost a bit of time to figure it out)
